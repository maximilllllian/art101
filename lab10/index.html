			<h2>- Challenge -</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JS events.</p>
			<h2>- Problems -</h2>
			<p>Our biggest problem with this lab was getting the text inputted to the field to print to the website
      after the button was pressed. Originally we were using the window prompt method but after rewatching
    the most recent lecture we figured out how to use .value to assign the inputted values to variables.</p>
			<h2>- Results -</h2>
			<p>We now have a our lab fully functioning with two buttons. One button takes a user's name and sorts it. The other button
      takes the user input and applies it to the title text.</p>

      <h2>Script Input</h2>

    <p>
      <label>Please enter your name<br>
        <input type= “text” id="user-name">
      </label>
      <button id = 'submit-button'>Submit</button>
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>Change the title here!<br>
      <input type= “text” id="title-text">
    </label>
      <button id = 'title-change'>Change the title!</button>
    <h2>Script Output</h2>
		  <div id = 'output'></div>
