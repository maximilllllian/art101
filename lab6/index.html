			<h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<p>Working with a partner and experiment with arrays and objects in JavaScript.</p>
			<h2>- Challenges -</h2>
			<p>Our challenge was to print a JavaScript array and object to this HTML file.</p>
			<h2>- Problems -</h2>
			<p>We had a hard time figuring out how to access the year property. It kept giving us an error message. In the end,
			 we decided to add the age value after we originally declared the object.</p>
			<h2>- Results -</h2>
			<p>At the end of the lab, I made this HTML file. I decided to make the JavaScript code talk about
				 the skateboard I'm currently riding instead of a car, as that is my main mode of transportation.
				Here is the JavaScript program execution:</p>
			<div id = 'chef'>
				<h3>Script Output:</h3>
				<script src = 'js/lab.js'></script>
			</div>
