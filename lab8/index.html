			<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<p>Working with a partner, experiment with anonymus functions and callbacks.</p>
			<h2>- Challenges -</h2>
			<p>It took me a while to understand the difference in writing anonymous functions
      and regular functions. Also, getting the functions to print out in 2, 3, 1 order
      proved difficult until I looked at the example and realized you have to put different
      time amounts after the function and the closed } instead of within the function.</p>
			<h2>- Problems -</h2>
			<p>I put an extra set of parentheses after my anonymous functions and didn't notice,
       so nothing was printing until I realized the issue in the console and fixed it in Atom.</p>
			<h2>- Results -</h2>
			<p>Go to the console to see the output!</p>
