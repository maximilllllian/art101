             Supporters of QAnon claimed that the "Great Reset" would take place after Joe Biden was sworn into office and many correlate it to the phrase "build back better" which has been a phrase repeatedly used by the Biden administration.
           It was coined by the United Nations and the framework for this process was outlined in the United Nations' Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.</div>
