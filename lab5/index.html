			<h1>Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<p>Working with a partner and experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
			<h2>- Challenges -</h2>
			<p>Our challenge was to use basic JavaScript data types and variables to reference and print a script to this html file.</p>
			<h2>- Problems -</h2>
			<p>It was annoying that I couldn't change any of the code that I wrote in the console
				so I just wrote the code in atom and copy and pasted it into the console.</p>
			<h2>- Results -</h2>
			<p>At the end of the lab, I made this html file. I decided to make the JavaScript code talk about
				 the skateboard I'm currently riding instead of a car, as that is my main mode of transportation.
				Here is the JavaScript program execution:</p>
			<div>
				<h3>Script Output:</h3>
				<script src = 'js/lab.js'></script>
			</div>
