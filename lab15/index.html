        <h2>- Challenges -</h2>
  			<p> Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</p>
			  <h2>- Problems -</h2>
        <p>Our biggest problem in the lab was trying to figure out where a JSON error was coming from.
        It turned out that we didn't have the correct API link. Once we got the correct API link, our website worked with no issue.</p>
        <h2>- Results -</h2>
