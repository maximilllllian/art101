			<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
        <h2>- Challenges -</h2>
  			<p> Working with a partner,  create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
			  <h2>- Problems -</h2>
        <p>The biggest issue we faced during this lab was our placement of brackets. We lost track of our brackets, especially
        when creating our conditional statement because there were just so many. We were struggling with a syntax error caused
        by a missing bracket from the conditional statement that we discovered when looking in our console. We eventually figured out
        that we needed another bracket at the end of our if/else if statements and that solved the issue.</p>
