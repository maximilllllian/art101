			<p id='cheese'>One of the challenges we faced in the beginning was finding our output and assigning it
        to variable outputEl because of issues with capitalization we discovered by looking at the console.</p>
			<h2>- Problems -</h2>
			<p id='crackers'> Our biggest problem was appending both new elements using appendChild() to our output div,
        we were made aware that this was the source of our issue by looking at the console. We tried adjusting many
        things in the console and searched on the web for solutions</p>
