			<h1>Functions</h1>
			<p>Working with a partner write functions and take user input.</p>
			<h2>- Challenges -</h2>
			<p>Our challenge was to use a window prompt to get a user's name and then sort their name into various different strings.</p>
			<h2>- Problems -</h2>
			<p>What was most challenging for this lab were the bonus tasks. We tried to make the anagram as requested, but unforunately that
			is the one bonus task that we had to omit because we were unsuccessful after many attempts.</p>
			<h2>- Results -</h2>
			<p>We now have a working function which prints a sorted string to the website. We styled this script using CSS. This is our finsihed product!</p>
