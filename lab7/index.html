			<h1>Functions</h1>
			<p>Working with a partner write functions and take user input.</p>
			<h2>- Challenges -</h2>
			<p>Our challenge was to use a window prompt to get a user's name and then sort their name into various different strings.</p>
			<h2>- Problems -</h2>
			<p>What was most challenging for this lab were the bonus tasks. We tried to make the anagram as requested, but unforunately that
			is the one bonus task that we had to omit because we were unsuccessful after many attempts.</p>
			<h2>- Results -</h2>
			<p>At the end of the lab, I made this HTML file. I decided to make the JavaScript code talk about
				 the skateboard I'm currently riding instead of a car, as that is my main mode of transportation.
				Here is the JavaScript program execution:</p>
